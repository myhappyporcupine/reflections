What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository with git init, a hidden directory .git is created. This also turns the folder into a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate location for files. The value such a location offers is that it allows for flexibility and testing of files you consider committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

After you've made all your changes, you stage one file and commit it, followed by the next etc.
