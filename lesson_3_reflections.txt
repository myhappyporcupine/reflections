When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I collaborate with other people, or when I use a different computer to view my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may not always be online. But I may also sometimes want to make changes locally before syncronising with the remote repository, like when I'm working on another person's repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instaed of another.

Forks are cloned repositories inside of GitHub that are reinitialized with a new owner. Clones are just copying a repository without changing anything. Branches are just new chains of commits, where the latest commit is given the branch's name.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows you to keep up to date with the remote repository. Espacially good when collaborating.
